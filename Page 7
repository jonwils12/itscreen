									<h3>Manager: New Hire Checklist</h3>        
									<h5>Use this checklist to streamline the onboarding process.	
									Also to help prepare for your new hire's arrival</h5>
									<br />
									<p>1. Submit tech requests to the T-Bar: The HOP > Life at DISH > Tools & Resources > T-Bar Online > Employee Onboarding.</p>
									<p>2. Each person should have the necessities: phone, access to necessary software, etc.</p>
									<p>3. Request desk space by reaching out to the location office manager or other applicable contact.</p>
									<p>4. Make sure their desk is clean. You can contact Facilities through the hop if its needing a deep clean, or missing items like a trash can or filing cabinet.</p>
									
									<p>5. Make sure they know when to arrive on their first full day; show them where their desk is.</p>
									<p>6. Once they've been assigned an email address, add new hire to distribution lists for team, pertinent
									emails, etc.</p>
									<br />
											<!--Orientation day-->

									<h3>DURING YOUR NEW HIRE'S ORIENTATION DAY</h3>
									
									<p>1. Check their tech set-up: make sure they have a monitor and docking station as appropriate; ensure their phone is programmed and ready.</p>
									<p>2. Provide basic office supplies (notebook, pens, highlighters, paperclips, stapler, etc.)</p>
									<p>3. Give them a tour of the building.
									<p>4. Plan to take them to lunch (cafe is fine)-you’ll receive a calendar invite letting you know when and where to pick them up. If you can't take them to lunch, ensure they know where to go on their first day.</p>
									<br />


											<!--First full day-->

									<h2>DURING YOUR NEW HIRE'S FIRST FULL DAY</h2>
									<br />
									<h3>Getting Settled:</h3>
									<p>1. Meet them at their desk on arrival; if you cannot meet them on arrival, have an email in their inbox detailing anything you'd like them to get started on (e.g. send them a rough outline of the meetings you’d like them to join and anything they can start to research).</p>
									<p>2. Walk them around and introduce them to other members of the team/department.</p>
									<p>3. Show them where office supplies are located.
									<p>4. Make sure their laptop/docking station set-up works. If not working reach out to T-Bar
									<p>5. Make sure they are set up for Follow-You Printing - have them print a test page.

									<p>2. Discuss any communication preferences (e.g. when you prefer email, Google Chat, or a call).</p>
									<p>3. Make sure they've been invited to any relevant meetings (via Google Calendar).</p>
									<p>4. Set a reminder for yourself about the benefit enrollment deadlines and make sure to talk to them prior to the close date to ensure they've explored options and made selections.</p>
									<p>5. Let them know about any upcoming priority projects, etc.</p>
